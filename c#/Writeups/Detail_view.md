In an ASP.NET MVC application, views are the files that define what the user sees on the screen, like web pages. These views are connected to controllers, which handle user input and decide what content to display.

**Views specific to a controller:** 
Each controller has its own folder inside the "Views" folder. For example, if you have a controller named "Home," the views for that controller will be stored in a folder called Views/Home.

**Shared views:**
If you have views that are used by multiple controllers (shared across different parts of your app), you put them in the Views/Shared folder.

To create a view for a specific controller action:<br>
1. Add a new file in the controller's folder inside the "Views" directory.
2. Name the file the same as the action in the controller, and give it a .cshtml extension.

For example, if you have an About action in the HomeController, you would create a file called About.cshtml inside the Views/Home folder. This file will be the view displayed when users visit the "About" page.

<code> 
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "About";
}
&lt;h2&gt;@ViewData["Title"].&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;@ViewData["Message"]&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use this area to provide additional information.&lt;/p&gt;


</code>

**Razor Markup:**

1. Razor is a syntax used in ASP.NET MVC views to combine C# code with HTML.
2. The @ symbol is used to switch from HTML to C# code. For example, if you want to insert C# code into your HTML, you use the @ symbol to start writing C# inside the HTML.

**Running C# Code:**
1. You can write C# code inside Razor by using curly braces { }. These are called Razor code blocks.
For example, in your view, you can assign a value to something like ViewData["Title"] = "About";. This would set the page title to "About".

**Displaying C# Values in HTML:**
1. If you want to display a C# value inside your HTML, just use the @ symbol followed by the variable name. For instance, you can show the title like this:
<code>&lt;h2&gt;@ViewData["Title"]&lt;/h2&gt;</code>
This will display the title on the page where the &lt;h2&gt; tag is.

**Page Layout:**
The HTML code you write in a view (like the  &lt;h2&gt; and &lt;h3&gt; tags) is just part of the complete page.
Other sections of the webpage, like the header, footer, or navigation, are managed by layout files or other shared view files that control the common structure of the whole page.

In summary, Razor allows you to mix C# code with HTML easily using the @ symbol, and the view you create is just one part of the complete webpage, with other parts managed by layout or shared views.
