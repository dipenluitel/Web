In an ASP.NET MVC application, views are the files that define what the user sees on the screen, like web pages. These views are connected to controllers, which handle user input and decide what content to display.

**Views specific to a controller:** 
Each controller has its own folder inside the "Views" folder. For example, if you have a controller named "Home," the views for that controller will be stored in a folder called Views/Home.

**Shared views:**
If you have views that are used by multiple controllers (shared across different parts of your app), you put them in the Views/Shared folder.

To create a view for a specific controller action:<br>
1. Add a new file in the controller's folder inside the "Views" directory.
2. Name the file the same as the action in the controller, and give it a .cshtml extension.

For example, if you have an About action in the HomeController, you would create a file called About.cshtml inside the Views/Home folder. This file will be the view displayed when users visit the "About" page.

<code> 
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "About";
}
&lt;h2&gt;@ViewData["Title"].&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;@ViewData["Message"]&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use this area to provide additional information.&lt;/p&gt;
